For TDD implementation, we should prioritise based on dependencies and foundational components. Here's the logical order:

Phase 1: Foundation Components (No Dependencies)

FileHasher - Pure utility functions, no external dependencies
ConfigLoader - Only depends on filesystem and standard libraries
PaginationStrategy - Self-contained logic with clear interfaces

Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

DatabaseManager - Needed by StateManager and data persistence
StateManager - Requires DatabaseManager, needed for recovery logic

Phase 3: External Communication

HTTPClient - Network operations, needed by main processing
PayloadValidator - Validates HTTPClient responses

Phase 4: Optional/Enhancement Components

CacheManager - Optional development feature
RateLimitTracker - Enhancement for usage monitoring

Phase 5: Recovery and Reporting

RecoveryManager - Depends on StateManager and FileHasher
ManifestGenerator - Reporting functionality

Phase 6: Orchestration

APIOrchestrator - Depends on all other components

This order ensures that:

Each component can be tested in isolation
Dependencies are available when needed
Core functionality is implemented before enhancements
You can validate the architecture early with foundational pieces
